This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/app](http://localhost:3000/app) (or your configured mount path) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Webflow Cloud mount path

This project reads a mount path from the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOUNT_PATH` and applies it to `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.ts`. If not provided, it defaults to `/app`.

Example local usage (bash):

```
export NEXT_PUBLIC_MOUNT_PATH=/app
npm run dev
```

In Webflow Cloud, configure your Environment to use the same mount path (e.g. `/app`).
